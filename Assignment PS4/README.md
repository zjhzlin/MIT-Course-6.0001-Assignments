### 4a - get permutation list of a string
Knowlege: 
1. use of recursive. How to think recursively 

Learning Notes:
1. Abstract. -> Use function to abstract the process
2. Learn from your own mistakes -> create bug database
3. If you feel tired and sleepy, you shouldn't think about how to code :) morning session is more efficient. 

To Improve:
1. other implementations without using recursive. 
2. difference of the two implementations? (recursive and non-recursive) benefits? sacrifice?


### 4b - encrypt and decrypt message (simple shift)
### 4c - encrypt and decrypt message (switch vowels)

Knowlege: 
1. use of class
2. call functions in other code
