###MIT-Course-6.0001 Assignments - Problem Sets 1 - 5

####Course Description
6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python is intended for students with little or no programming experience. It aims to provide students with an understanding of the role computation can play in solving problems and to help students, regardless of their major, feel justifiably confident of their ability to write small programs that allow them to accomplish useful goals. The class uses the Python 3.5 programming language.

####Duration
1. Video Lectures: 9 days (20/03/2021 - 28/03/2021)
2. Assignments: 12 days (21/03/2021 - 1/4/2021)
- Detailed timing can be found in the codes top comments section. 
- I find it helpful to keep track of the learning progress

####Knowledge
1. Bisection search
2. Use of different data structures: list, tuple, dictionary, etc
3. Use of function
4. Recursive 
5. Object Programming - class, subclass, abstract class

####Learning notes: 
1. Good coding structure and good style is very important -> refer to the course style guide
2. Skeleton given by the assignment is very useful in implementing the code. Something to learn from for future project. 
3. This is the entry-level course into the object programming. A bit difficult to understand the concept and usage of class (especially abstract class in the last assignment) at first. But gradually can see its benefits. Still need to practice more.
