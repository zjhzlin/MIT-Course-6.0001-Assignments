good use of function, naming of the parameters and function, and consistant comments

2. Learn shortcuts along the way. Fast use of shortcuts goes a long away. It shows the experience and efficiency

3. Before writing the code, first think about the structure. How to combine the same doings into a function. Logic is key. 

4. Start now - daily reflections and progress tracking. → github project uploading.
