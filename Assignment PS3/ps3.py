	The score for a word is the product of two components:

	The first component is the sum of the points for letters in the word.
	The second component is the larger of:

            7*wordlen - 3*(n-wordlen), where wordlen is the length of the word
            and n is the hand length when the word was played

	worth 3, C is worth 3, D is worth 2, E is worth 1, and so on.
